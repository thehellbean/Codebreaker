Codebreaker
==============

This is a simple script written in Python that finds a code using multiple guesses and clues from the user.

Example:
The code is 1234
The script guesses 1122
The first 1 is the right number in the right spot. The second 1 is completely wrong. 
The first 2 is the right number but in the wrong spot. The second 2 is completely wrong.

The user input would be "1 1", the first 1 denotes the amount of numbers completely right (right spot and right number).

The second 1 denotes the amount of numbers that are in the code but not in the right spot.
